                Sure, you touch your phone, but it's more sophisticated than that.
                You tap. You drag. You swipe right and left. You pull down to refresh.
                You pinch and stretch.

                Do you two-finger double tap? Do you triple-finger triple tap?

                If you took the phone away, it would almost look like a form of sign language.
